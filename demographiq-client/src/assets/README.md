# Assets

This directory contains static assets used by the Angular application.

These assets are typically copied directly to the output build directory (`dist/`) without processing by the Angular CLI's build pipeline (unless specifically configured otherwise).

Common examples include:

-   Images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`)
-   Fonts (`.woff`, `.woff2`)
-   Icons
-   JSON data files
-   Internationalization (i18n) translation files

Files placed here can be referenced in your application code or CSS using relative paths from the root, typically starting with `/assets/`.
